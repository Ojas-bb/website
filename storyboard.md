# 3D Spaceship Assembly Animation Storyboard

## 1. Initial State (Pre-Scroll)

*   **Scene:** Empty, dark space with a few distant, twinkling stars.
*   **Camera:** Static, wide-angle shot, looking at the center of the screen where the spaceship will assemble.
*   **Spaceship Parts:** All parts (hull, wings, cockpit, boosters, bolts) are positioned off-screen, ready to be animated.

## 2. Animation Triggered by Scrolling

### Scene 2.1: The Hull Arrives

*   **User Action:** User begins to scroll down the page.
*   **Animation:**
    *   The **hull** flies in from the top of the screen, moving quickly and then slowing down as it approaches the center.
    *   It has a slight rotation as it moves, giving it a dynamic feel.
*   **Camera:** The camera zooms in slightly to focus on the hull.

### Scene 2.2: Wings and Cockpit Assembly

*   **User Action:** Continued scrolling.
*   **Animation:**
    *   The **left and right wings** fly in from the sides of the screen. They move in a sweeping arc and attach to the hull with a satisfying "click" (sound can be added in the web implementation).
    *   Simultaneously, the **cockpit** flies in from the front (towards the camera) and merges smoothly with the top of the hull.
    *   A few **bolts** fly in and orbit around the connection points of the wings and cockpit, simulating them being fastened.
*   **Camera:** The camera pans and rotates to follow the wings as they attach, providing a cinematic view of the assembly process.

### Scene 2.3: Booster Attachment

*   **User Action:** Further scrolling.
*   **Animation:**
    *   The **booster** section flies in from the bottom of the screen, glowing with a soft, pulsating light.
    *   It aligns with the back of the hull and docks into place.
    *   As it docks, the glowing effect intensifies for a moment.
    *   More **bolts** fly in and secure the booster section.
*   **Camera:** The camera angle changes to a three-quarter view from the back, highlighting the booster attachment and its glowing elements.

## 3. Fully Assembled (Mid-Scroll)

*   **Scene:** The spaceship is now fully assembled in the center of the screen.
*   **Animation:**
    *   The spaceship hovers, rotating slowly to give the user a 360-degree view.
    *   The booster's glow is now a steady, soft pulse.
    *   The remaining bolts find their final positions on the spaceship's body.
*   **Camera:** The camera performs a slow, circular dolly movement around the spaceship, showcasing its sleek design from all angles.

## 4. The Launch (End of Scroll Animation)

*   **User Action:** User reaches the end of the scroll animation section.
*   **Animation:**
    *   The spaceship's boosters flare up with a bright, intense light.
    *   The ship tilts downwards and accelerates rapidly, flying "down" and out of the view.
    *   A subtle lens flare effect can be used as the boosters fire up.
*   **Camera:** The camera tilts down to follow the spaceship as it launches, then returns to a forward-facing view of the now-empty space, ready for the rest of the website content to appear.

## Animation & Design Notes:

*   **Pacing:** The animation should be smooth and directly tied to the scroll progress. The user should feel in control of the assembly.
*   **Easing:** Use ease-in-out functions for the movement of the parts to make the animation feel more natural and less robotic.
*   **Lighting:** Dynamic lighting should be used to highlight the metallic surfaces and create dramatic shadows, enhancing the futuristic look.
*   **Modularity:** Each part is a separate mesh, allowing for independent control over its position, rotation, and timing in the animation. This storyboard is designed to take full advantage of that modularity.
